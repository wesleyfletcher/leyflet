Data scrapers

- Currently have NET, Torvik, and Kenpom
- Also need AP and maybe coaches poll
- Maybe will do Massey and any others
- scrapers can be run in parallel
    - need to study `multiprocessing` library
    - once done can construct a composite table

- all team name variants are held in json
    - assumes case insensitive and dashes equal spaces
    - for conversion should remove periods, parentheses, commas
